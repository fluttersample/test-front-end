## 📝 Description (What It does)
This app fetches the data from the [numbersapi.com](http://numbersapi.com/#42) website

Working is very simple, the user will just type the number on the search field and press the button on the main screen, which will fetch the trivia for that particular number user typed. And when they press the button named RANDOM, that will fetch any random trivia and show it on the text widget of the main screen
